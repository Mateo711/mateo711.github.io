        <h2> <u>Purpose: </u></h2>

        <p>
            The reason I am creating this technical journal is to track my progress in my Software Engineering career.
            Before this journal, I had only ever created projects as class assignments and had never created my own personal projects.
            I hope that by the end of this technical journal I have created a handful of personal projects which I could cite in my resume
            and hopefully give myself a better chance of getting hired in the future. I also hope to acquire a few new software skills and learn a
            little bit of programming languages that I am not very familiar with.
        </p>

        <h2> <u>Day 1 - March 14th, 2024 (Website Development): </u></h2>

        <p>
            The first project that I am going to be creating is my own website from scratch. I will be coding everything that goes into this website by
            myself rather than using a website developer like Wix.com. I began by watching multiple YouTube videos of people explaining how to create websites from scrach
            and realized that one key feature to all of these websites is that they use HTML programming language, which I was not very familiar with. So, my next step
            was to look into how to code in HTML. So, I went back onto YouTube and spent a few hours researching how to code in HTML. Today I did not accomplish any physical
            code on my laptop but rather just learned about how I could start this website.
        </p>

        <h2> <u>Day 2 - March 16th, 2024 (Website Development): </u></h2>

        <p>
            The goal for Day 2 was to begin my website. I wanted to test out some of the HTML features that I learned about on Day 1. I just began inserting some of these
            features. The first feature that I added was a link to an external source. The next feature I added was an image to appear on the website. After that I created
            generic fruit lists, using both a bulleted list and a numeric list, each with a sublist within it. Finally, I added a generic table to my website with table
            headings as well as table data. Below is the work I accomplished on Day 2.

        <h2> <u>Day 3 - March 21st, 2024 (Basic Calulator): </u></h2>

        <p>
            The goal for Day 3 was to create a basic calculator using Java. I already had a basic understanding of Java however, I did not have much experience
            designing anything in Java. So, I looked up how to create actual apps in Java and after researching this information for about a half hour, I began trying
            to create my own app which consisted of the basic calculator function, which I already knew how to program. The process of designing the calculator was tedious
            due to the fact that I had to "trial and error" my code to get it the way I wanted it to look. I tried looking up how to get my program embedded into my
            website but I found that embedding my program into here would take a lot longer than I would have wanted it to. So instead, I have just decided to upload photos
            of my program running below:

        <h2> <u>Day 4 - April 1st, 2024 (Uploading Website Online): </u></h2>

        <p>
            I was originally going to try to get my Day 3 project embedded. However, I decided that rather than spending a bunch of my time trying to
            add my last project to the website, I would rather get my website online. Today I searched how to host my website online and most of the things I
            found told me that I would need to pay for a website domain and host. However, I learned that I can host my website by creating a GitHub account and doing it 
            there. The only issue I found with this is that the images that I uploaded into my website do not appear properly on the internet like they do on my local
            computer. I believe it is due to the size of the images.
        </p>

 <h2> <u>Day 5 - April 7th, 2024 (Uploading Website Online): </u></h2>

 <p>
     After looking up a bunch of stuff about GitHub over the past week and coming up short, I eventually ended up figuring out the issue.
     When I uploaded my files to my GitHub account, I created a folder with all of the images I would end up using on the website. So, I had to take all of
     the saved images out from the folder and when I went to open the website online, all of the images had shown up correctly. An example of what all the images
     would look like is below:

 For the image below, I am grabbing an image file that I know does not exist on my laptop, let alone my uploaded GitHub code.

 <h2> <u>Day 6 - April 10th, 2024 (Tic-Tac-Toe Game): </u></h2>

 <p>
     For what will most likely be my last day of this technical notebook I wanted to make a small game to help further my Java abilities. I created a Tic Tac Toe
     game using some of the design skills I learned in Java during this project to create a reactive board that when a player clicks on, it changes to either
     an X or an O depending on which turn it is. I also decided to add a notification to the game which announces when a player wins. This was one of the more difficult
     projects I've done in my programming career, mainly because I needed the game to not only be reactive but also register when someone gets a
     "Tic Tac Toe." I again had a hard time trying to embed this into my website, so here are some pictures of the program being run.

 <h2> <u>Conclusion: </u></h2>

 <p>
     I really enjoyed making this technical journal. Although it isn't a traditional technical journal, it still kept me focused on achieving an end goal 
     that I wanted to accomplish. I didn't accomplish everything I had hoped to accomplish throughout this process however, I did end up accomplishing some
     things I did not originally plan. For example, I knew that I wanted to create a website to track my progress but I did not originally think that I needed
     to create a domain or location apart from my laptop which I needed to upload this project to for others to view it. Because if I had not put my 
     website on GitHub, no other devices apart from my laptop would be able to view the website I created. I wish that I would have been able to embed my other
     projects into this website before submitting this. I know that I will have to learn how to do this in the future though for future employers to see 
     all of my projects in one place. I would definitely do another field journal in the future because I feel like not only does it allow me to get all of my progress
     down in one location but I also feel like it holds me accountable for my work.
